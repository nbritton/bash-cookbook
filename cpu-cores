# Surprisingly it is not very straightforward to query, in a scriptable way, how many real cpu cores are present.
# While it is trivial find the total number of logical cores, it is a lot more difficult to ascertain if
# these are multi-threading frontends or real cpu cores.

# This script returns the real core count of a system, as a single numerical value.

# This has been confirmed to work on a 4-way E7-8895 v2 and 2-way E5-2640 v3 system with hyper-threading enabled:
awk '{if (/^siblings/) {siblings+=$3}}; {if (/^cpu cores/) {count+=1; cores+=$4}} END {print count/(siblings/cores)}' /proc/cpuinfo

# Examples:
# nbritton@lab01:~$ cores=$(awk '{if (/^siblings/) {siblings+=$3}}; {if (/^cpu cores/) {count+=1; cores+=$4}} END {print count/(siblings/cores)}' /proc/cpuinfo)
# nbritton@lab01:~$ echo $cores;
# 60

# Debug Example:
# Column 1: Total sibling count
# Column 2: Total cores count
# Column 3: Number of entries in /proc/cpuinfo (i.e. logical cores)
# Real Cores = Column_3 / ( Column_1 / Column_2)
# nbritton@lab01:~$ awk '{if (/^siblings/) {siblings+=$3}}; {if (/^cpu cores/) {count+=1; cores+=$4}} END {print siblings" "cores" "count}' /proc/cpuinfo
# 3600 1800 120
